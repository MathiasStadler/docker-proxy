#Howto Exclude Few Sites from Caching
* from here
*  https://aacable.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/squid-howto-exclude-some-sites-exntension-from-caching/

* ``` acl NO-CACHE-SITES dstdomain "/etc/squid/not-to-cache-sites.txt"
no_cache deny NO-CACHE-SITES
acl sharing_server dst 10.0.0.1
cache deny sharing_server

Now create the file which will contains our sites list which we donâ€™t want to cache.

touch /etc/squid/not-to-cache-sites.txt

and add  your desired web sites name in /etc/squid/not-to-cache-sites.txt
For example

nano /etc/squid/not-to-cache-sites.txt


and add following or your entries

bankalhabib.com
aacable.wordpress.com
wordpress.com
nae.com.pk
jang.com.pk ```
